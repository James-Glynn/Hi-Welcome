# Hi-Welcome
2019 Transfer Bridge to UCLA Samueli Hack-a-thon project



Hack-a-thon Challenge: “Over the course of the next three days, your team will develop a mechanical arm that can be controlled via Bluetooth. [...] The completed mechanical arm must be able to pick up a selection of small objects unassisted, receiving input from a user’s smartphone.”



Included is our frontend & backend code to interface with the bluetooth on the arduino.
